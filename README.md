# Suricata – Reports Dashboard (Grafana / Loki)

This repository contains a Suricata monitoring dashboard used for visualizing network activity, alerts, protocol usage, DNS/HTTP behavior, and overall traffic health.  
It is designed as a *raw data exchange space* for AI‑assisted improvements, modifications, and dashboard refactoring.

## 📌 Overview

The dashboard is built for:

- **Grafana**
- **Loki** (as the log datasource)
- **Promtail** (Suricata log ingestion)
- Suricata `eve.json` logs

It provides:

- Suricata alert visibility  
- DNS/HTTP activity breakdown  
- IPv4 / IPv6 protocol visibility  
- Port distribution  
- Baseline activity health (including stdev spikes)  
- Raw log inspection  
- Optional sections for fileinfo, flow, and service categorization  

The dashboard uses Loki log queries to process Suricata events and visualize real‑time and historical activity in your environment.

## 📂 Structure

This repository includes:

- `suricata-reports_v0.json` – The original or partially modified dashboard.
- `suricata-reports_v2.json` – The redesigned and optimized dashboard generated by AI assistance _(once finalized)_.
- Supporting temporary files used during dashboard reconstruction.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- **Grafana 9.x – 11.x**  
  (Dashboard model uses the new panel structure and fieldConfig schema)
- **Grafana Loki** as log backend  
- **Promtail** properly configured to ingest Suricata’s `eve.json` logs  
- Suricata generating structured JSON logs (default Eve format)

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Import the Dashboard
In Grafana:

1. Go to **Dashboards → Import**
2. Upload `suricata-reports_v2.json`
3. Select your existing **Loki datasource**
4. Save the dashboard

The dashboard displays immediately with no additional configuration required.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Provide a reproducible baseline for Suricata visualization.
- Allow AI‑assisted dashboard cleanup and redesign.
- Keep dashboard JSON and related artifacts accessible in RAW form.
- Provide a clean version (v2) with:
  - improved layout,
  - correct panel grouping,
  - cleaner legend formatting,
  - optimized Loki queries,
  - better IPv6/IPv4 separation,
  - reduced noise,
  - improved “health check” and anomaly detection.
